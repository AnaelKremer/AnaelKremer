I work at Inist - CNRS :office:, where I carry out bibliometric studies :bar_chart:.

I'm not a developer, but I love tinkering with algorithmic problems, playing with data transformations, and working with Lodash, Lodex, EZS and more...

## Here are a few side projects I’ve worked on:

#### :notebook: Atelier Lodash

A workshop on the Lodash library in the context of Lodex.

#### :mag: RnsrLearnDetect Validation

A process designed to simplify affiliation detection by consolidating the results from the rnsrLearnDetect web service.

#### Other Contributions

- **[Loader query Conditor](https://github.com/Inist-CNRS/lodex/blob/master/workers/loaders/query-conditor.ini)** – A loader that retrieves and structures data from a Conditor query.  
- **[Loader query OpenAlex](https://github.com/Inist-CNRS/lodex/blob/master/workers/loaders/query-openalex.ini)** – A loader that retrieves and structures data from an OpenAlex query. My colleagues and I have published :page_with_curl: on this topic [here](https://cnrs.hal.science/hal-05003502v1/document).
